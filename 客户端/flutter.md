# Widget

第一次学习flutter的widget，整理称笔记记录下。

1. 什么是widget

    在官网中的解释如下

    > Flutter widgets are built using a modern framework that takes inspiration from [React](https://reactjs.org/). The central idea is that you build your UI out of widgets. Widgets describe what their view should look like given their current configuration and state. When a widget’s state changes, the widget rebuilds its description, which the framework diffs against the previous description in order to determine the minimal changes needed in the underlying render tree to transition from one state to the next.
